# Stroke Prediction
## Description
The Stroke Prediction application was implemented as a final project for ITCS 6150 - Knowledge Discovery in Databases Course at University of North Carolina at Charlotte during Fall 2021.

Stroke is a medical disorder that occurs when there is damage to blood arteries. It can also happen if blood stops flowing to the brain.It is the most common cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. It is the fifth-highest cause of mortality, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Prior identification of this medical condition could help save the lives of people by providing appropriate medical support. With the help of machine learning, we can identify the chance of occurrence of stroke. So, the goal of this project would be to predict the accuracy of a person getting a stroke based on the textual data provided by Kaggle.

Our research Question is **"Predict the accuracy of a person getting a stroke based on the textual data"**

## Executing program
### Dependencies

To run the program , following libraries are required:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn for Visualizations.
* Jupyter Notebook
## Conclusion

* The details explanation about the project work is explained in the above [a link](Conclusion.docx).



## Future Work

* We are having high accuracy on test and train data but we would like to improve it more.
* The major drawback is that the current model would only work on textual data and not on real-world image datasets. We would improvise the model in a way that could work on heart or brain CT scan images.
