# Project for Knowledge Discovery in Databases

We are working on using CRISP-DM process and standard datamining techniques to data which can be obtained from opendata.
Our Dataset is located in Data Resources folder

## Description

The CRISP-DM process begins with business and data understanding, and then moves to data preparation and modeling. Then the models are evaluated, and the results are deployed. 

Our research Question is **"Predict the accuracy of a person getting a stroke based on the textual data"**

## Data source link

## Future Work
* Apply Modelling to the current
* Our future goal would be to train the model in the least time possible. 
* The major drawback is that the current model would only work on textual data and not on real-world image datasets. We would improvise the model in a way that could work on heart or brain CT scan images.

## Getting Started
